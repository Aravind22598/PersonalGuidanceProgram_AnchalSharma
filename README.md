Welcome to my repository of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) assignments, guided by my mentor Anchal Sharma (currently working at Myntra).

This repo serves as:

📂 A collection of all assignments & solutions I complete during the mentorship.

📝 A place to maintain notes and learnings for quick revision.

📈 A tracker of my progress and consistency.




🚀 Goals

Strengthen problem-solving skills in DSA.

Improve coding speed & accuracy.

Develop a systematic learning record.

Prepare for coding interviews at top tech companies.
